## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I enjoyed learning to follow a design that was given to me rather than designing and redesigning myself as I went along!

I reinforced the lesson that I cannot vertically center a div without setting a specific height on the parent!!


### Continued development

I'm looking forward to expanding my skills to effectively convert a given design into a responsive accessible document.

### Useful resources

- [MDN webdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me quickly find the properties I wanted to use with my CSS flex elements
